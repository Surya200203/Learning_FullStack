			A wealthy American business magnate, playboy, philanthropist, inventor and
			ingenious scientist, <b>Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark</b> suffers a severe
			chest injury during a kidnapping. When his captors attempt to force him to
			build a weapon of mass destruction, he instead creates a mechanized suit
			of armor to save his life and escape captivity. Later, Stark develops his
			suit, adding weapons and other technological devices he designed through
			his company, Stark Industries. He uses the suit and successive versions to
			protect the world as Iron Man. Although at first concealing his true
			identity, Stark eventually publicly reveals himself to be Iron Man.
